# Analysis of COVID-19 Geospatially using Python

    COVID-19 is a pandemic which slowed all the daily process which happens in the world except its spread rate. The pandemic is considered to be the biggest disaster of the century and eventually will go in history for questioning the development and inventions made in health sector. Where it took many months to invent the vaccine which enhance the immune system in the fight against COVID-19. So the analysis of thw widespread disease throughout the world is an important thing to do with its spatial representation.

# Scope and the objective of the study
    
To analysis the spread of COVID-19 and visualise it graphically.
    1. To estimate the infection rate and the effects from the period of pre-COVID to post-COVID.
    2. To visualize the spread graphically and geospatially.

# Data used

    COVID-19 spread datasets are downloaded form the kaggle.
    The dataset segregated into rows and columns. Where the datasets are divided by the basis of country/region, latitude, longitude, infection rate, dates etc...

# Result
    The COVID-19 infection rate for countries like India, France, United Kingdom, Canada are shown in the plot.
